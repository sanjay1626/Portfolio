# Title
Personal Responsive Portfolio

# Description
Created a simple styled portfolio, which contains three pages linked to each other.
The About Me, that gives a short description of myself
The Portfolio, that shows projects that are completed by myself
The Contact, that allows users to input their contact info and message
Design was more on just a professional simple look and would need to develop more on to the page design and response
